This repo contains homework I submitted for a course in discrete mathematics taught by Dr. [Jiuzu Hong](http://hong.web.unc.edu/) (洪久族) in the Spring 2017 semester at the University of North Carolina.

All section and problem numbers refer to Kenneth Rosen's *Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications*, 7<sup>th</sup> edition.
